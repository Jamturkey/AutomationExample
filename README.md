# AutomationExample
This is an example of a past automated test case I created at StayHealthy.
The "Manage Clients" test case is part of a larger suite I just ripped out as an example.

One of the requirements the company had for the test suite was to verify many different elements on the page. This required me to include many asserts to verify text and validations which is not generally recommended to do at all.

I utilized the PageObject model and included some of the page objects for this case in the "Objects" folder.
