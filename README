This is an example of a past automated test case I created at StayHealthy.
The "Manage Clients" test case is part of a larger suite I just ripped out as an example.
	
One of the requirements for the test suite was to verify many different elements on the page. 
This required me to include many asserts which is not something I'd recommended.
	
I utilized the PageObject model and included some of the page objects for this case in the "Objects" folder.
